# NAP Tech Web Dev Test

This is a chance for you to show us how you think we should be displaying our product catalog.

## Task

* Build a dynamic product listing page using the product API

###You should include 
 
* Implement pagination/infinite scroll
* Include Filters and sorts (eg. lowest price first, select a size)
* A mix of server and clientside rendering
* It should be device agnostic

### Things to note

* Aesthetics are very important to the Net-a-porter brand but so is performance
* Don't worry about header/footer
* Use any library/framework you deem applicable

The following are examples of the existing mobile and desktop listing pages:

* [Mobile](public/mobile.jpg)
* [Desktop](public/desktop.jpg)

You can replicate these or if you think there is something we should be doing, or it should work another way - feel free to be creative but tell us why and what you think we are doing wrong.
